## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5100](http://localhost:5100) with your browser to see the result.


[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:5100/api/graphql](http://localhost:5100/api/graphql). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/graphql.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
